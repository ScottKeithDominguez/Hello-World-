# Security Setup Instructions

This document outlines the security features that have been configured for this repository and the additional steps needed.

## ✅ Completed (via code)

The following security features have been set up through code and configuration files:

1. **SECURITY.md** - Security policy file
   - Located at: `/SECURITY.md`
   - Provides vulnerability reporting guidelines
   - Explains the security response process

2. **CodeQL Analysis** - Automated code scanning
   - Located at: `/.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
   - Runs on: push to main, pull requests, and weekly schedule
   - Note: The language matrix is currently empty `[]`. Update it based on the programming languages used in your project.

3. **LICENSE** - BSD-3-Clause License
   - Located at: `/LICENSE`
   - Standard BSD 3-Clause license text

## ⚙️ Manual Configuration Required

The following security features **must be enabled manually** in the GitHub repository settings by the repository owner:

### 1. Secret Scanning
**Path:** Settings → Security & analysis → Secret scanning → Enable

This feature scans for accidentally committed secrets like API keys, passwords, and tokens.

### 2. Dependabot Alerts
**Path:** Settings → Security & analysis → Dependabot alerts → Enable

Automatically detects vulnerable dependencies and suggests updates.

### 3. Dependabot Security Updates
**Path:** Settings → Security & analysis → Dependabot security updates → Enable

Automatically creates pull requests to update vulnerable dependencies.

### 4. Private Vulnerability Reporting
**Path:** Settings → Security & analysis → Private vulnerability reporting → Enable

Allows security researchers to privately report vulnerabilities.

## 🔧 CodeQL Configuration

The CodeQL workflow currently has an empty language matrix. To enable code scanning for your project's languages, update line 34 in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`:

```yaml
language: [ 'javascript-typescript' ]  # Example for JavaScript/TypeScript
```

Supported languages:
- `c-cpp`
- `csharp`
- `go`
- `java-kotlin`
- `javascript-typescript`
- `python`
- `ruby`
- `swift`
